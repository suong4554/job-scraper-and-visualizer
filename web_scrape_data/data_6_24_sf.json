How do we ensure that our models are robust and unbiased?\nEvaluation - How do we assess the quality of our algorithms and models? What is the ground truth we use to judge them? Where do they succeed and how do they fail? These problems are even more subtle in the complex, creative domains of Adobe products – for example, how should we judge the quality of similarity search, where a user finds new images with an image as the query?\nWe’re looking for data scientists to define, drive, and coordinate training data construction and model evaluation for the Applied Machine Learning team at Adobe. This will involve thinking hard about product quality, the role of machine learning in those products, and the capabilities of large-scale human-judgment tasks to support scalable solutions that generate the fuel for success of our AI/ML algorithms.\nResponsibilities:\nWork closely with product, research, and engineering leaders to understand ML applications and define success.\nInteract with APIs to effectively sample raw data to optimize for ML training and evaluation.\nDesign tasks and guidelines for human judgment jobs to annotate images, videos, text, audio; and also to measure the performance of machine-learned and other advanced algorithms.\nHelp design A/B tests for our cloud offerings, and use human judgment vs. end-user A/B tests as appropriate\nCreate a winning culture built on collaboration and shared accomplishments- have fun along the way!\nQualifications:\nBS or MS in a technical field (Computer Science, Physics, Math, Statistics) OR in a human-centered field such as Psychology, Linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction.\nExposure to applied machine learning in an enterprise setting.\nProven experience in validation and evaluation of machine learned models.\nStrong quantitative and analytical orientation. Experience in evaluation metrics, Python or R, JSON parsing, custom HTML for visualization.\nStrong qualitative skillset. Experience in taxonomies, survey design.\nUnderstanding of issues around ground truth and training/evaluation data for ML, including human judgment and A/B testing\nHands-on experience using third-party judgment services such as Figure 8, Appen, or Amazon Mechanical Turk.\nAt Adobe, you will be immersed in an exceptional work environment that is recognized throughout the world on Best Companies lists . You will also be surrounded by colleagues who are committed to helping each other grow through our unique Check-In approach where ongoing feedback flows freely.\nIf you’re looking to make an impact, Adobe's the place for you.

The HIDA will be expected to leverage their knowledge of data management, data analysis tools, and statistical methods, along with understanding of how care is organized and delivered in an academic medical center, to assist in the construction of research datasets. These datasets will be used to collaboratively investigate complex problems pertaining to the use and impact of health information technology on clinician behaviors, processes in health care delivery and patient outcomes. Examples of previous work include understanding the role of information sharing between hospitals in clinical decision making, measuring the impact of frequency and time of documentation on physician burnout, and assessing documentation patterns of social determinants of health within the electronic health record.\n\nThis work is primarily based around existing data that is captured within UCSF’s Epic System EHR reporting framework (Clarity & Caboodle). A key task will be extracting a specific type of metadata - audit log data - from Epic’s Clarity module, linking it to clinical data and administrative data, and creating measures and analytic data sets in support of research studies. The individual will also participate in the preparation of manuscripts and presentations to disseminate research.\n\nThe applicant will be a part of a team within CLIIR, collaborating closely with multiple faculty researchers as well as clinical and business stakeholders within the UCSF Health system.\n\nThis position has significant advantages and growth opportunities. First, through their work, the HIDA will gain tremendous insight into the clinical, administrative, educational, and research functions of a large academic medical center. A motivated analyst can use this knowledge to become a more integral member of academic projects and to even start providing guidance to them, as prior analysts have done. Second, CLIIR faculty publish their work in peer-reviewed journals and would provide the HIDA with authorship on publications, should they meet standard contribution criteria.\n\nIf necessary, the HIDA will be funded to receive training with Epic Systems in the use of Clarity (the relational database that runs behind their Epic electronic health record). In addition, strong written and verbal communication is key for this role since much of the work involves understanding and explaining nuanced and complex processes and communicating with both technical and non-technical audiences.\nDepartment Description\nThe Center for Clinical Informatics and Improvement Research (CLIIR) was launched in September 2017 at UCSF and was created out of a critical need to understand how to use digital tools to improve quality and value. CLIIR’s mission is to discover ways: (1) to leverage Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and other sources of digital data to improve clinical performance and healthcare value, and (2) to scale these results to promote healthcare transformation. CLIIR resides within the Department of Medicine (DOM), with a specific tie to the Division of Hospital Medicine (DHM) at UCSF. The Center also has close ties to Institute for Health Policy Studies (IHPS), Center for Digital Health Innovation (CDHI), the Baker Institute, and other digital health initiatives at UCSF. CLIIR is led by a Professor at UCSF and the nation’s foremost expert in digital health policy and use to derive healthcare value.\n\nCLIIR is administered from within DHM at UCSF. DHM is a national leader in clinical care, research, quality improvement, and medical education.\nRequired Qualifications\nBachelor's degree in Biological or Physical Sciences, or Computer/Computational/Data Science, or Domain Sciences with computer/computational/data specialization and minimum 3 years of experience or equivalent combination of experience/education\nIntermediate knowledge and at least 2 years of experience with an analytic programming language such as R or Python\nIntermediate knowledge of SQL\nKnowledge of statistical approaches and analysis techniques\nPrior academic and/or healthcare experience in a complex academic and clinical health care environment\nPrevious experience working with large datasets\nExperience in developing academic products (e.g. abstracts, manuscripts, workshops, posters, etc.)\nIntermediate knowledge of HPC/data science (programming language - e.g. SAS, Python, R, SQL, Stata, etc.)\nAdvanced skills, and demonstrated experience associated with one or more of the following: HPC software power and performance analysis and research, design, modification, Implementation and deployment of HPC or data science applications and tools.

Our solution is currently deployed in hundreds of grocery stores across the United States and is on track to reduce 30 million pounds of food waste per year with our existing customers alone. By 2021, we're aiming to reduce food waste by a quarter billion pounds per year.\nThe Modeling and Optimization team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies.\nWe are looking for a Principal Applied Scientist to lead the R&D work at Afresh. You will take your existing knowledge of forecasting, simulation, and stochastic optimization and apply it to the challenging and important problem of perishable inventory control. You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core replenishment system. This will include modeling consumer demand, item-level perishability, and complex multi-echelon supply chains. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.\nWhat you will do:\nYou will work on improving the core models of our system: demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and simulation. You will also lead research development for new product and business challenges. You will model the complex problems of inventory decay, promotions, price elasticity, and inventory uncertainty, and implement solutions to multi-stage and multi-echelon inventory optimization problems.\nIn your first 3 months, you will acquire an encyclopedic knowledge of perishable inventory control and Afresh's core decision making problem. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and simulation tools, and you'll test an experimental improvement to our demand forecasting, ordering, or simulation models.\nBy the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to our core modeling system.\nBy the end of your first year, you will have led the implementation of fundamental changes to our core system and led research into new product areas (warehouse level replenishment, production planning).\nWe need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof. This is not an analytics team.\nWhat skills and experience do you need?\n5+ years of industrial or academic experience building systems that deal with large-scale decision making under uncertainty. Some possible prior research areas are inventory optimization, supply chain management, network optimization, forecasting, game theory, decision analysis, or stochastic and approximate dynamic programming.\nExcellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English and easily translate business requirements into constrained optimization problems.\nAbility to independently deliver high quality software implementations of your solutions in the Python data stack (numpy/torch/pandas/etc). Knowing Python before joining is not required.\nPhD in Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related quantitative field\nAfresh is the first A.I.-powered fresh food optimization platform for grocery chains. We have partnered with several large grocers representing hundreds of stores and >$10B in revenue. Our cutting-edge AI research has been published in top journals (e.g., ICML).
